# Toaztr Web App

The goal of this app is to provide a visual layer on top of our API.
The layer is the minimum needed to build a client case and run a simulation.

In order to be able to login and call Toaztr API, you will need a subscription key.

## Development
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Therefore, you can use all the ng commands (`ng serve`, `ng build`, `ng test`).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Run with mock server

To run with a basic mock server, you can run `npm run k7` and then run `ng serve`.

## Update OpenApi

Update the version of "@toaztr/specs" in package.json.
